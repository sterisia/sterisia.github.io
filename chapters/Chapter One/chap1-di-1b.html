            <p>You were paused by a kind-looking man, who was donning a uniform-like vest with a subtle crest of a little bear threaded onto the right pocket. The same crest you'd been seeing all throughout your home, actually.</p>

            <p>You looked at the man in confusion, until it dawned on you that this man was one of your home's hired staff. Judging from his attire, his manner of speech, how he addressed you, and your obvious status quo, it didn't seem like an unreasonable assumption at all.</p>
            <p>Then if you were paying attention to your dictionary surfing, you would know that this man was a planet at your home. A planet, and possibly a personal <em>piloter</em> who warps his employers around in their aetherines.</p>
