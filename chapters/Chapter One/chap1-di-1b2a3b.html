            <p>After about five minutes, you found yourself at a very familiar-looking pole and glass box setup. According to your sterisia, this was your 'AT' stop.</p>

            <p>A couple more minutes later, an impressive-looking vehicle pulled to a stop in front of you. You frowned when you noticed that the 'bus' had no wheels and was therefore hovering over the ground by an inch or so. What's more, the vehicle appeared almost of translucent quality, like something that couldn't be physically touched.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it was a hologram, or some light-based concept, as many things in this universe seemed to rely on.</p>

            <p>But the door opened for you nonetheless, so you boarded. That's when you realized you had no idea how to pay your fare, so you awkwardly glanced at the AT's piloter. Cringing internally, you mustered up the courage to ask a seemingly stupid question.</p>

            <p>Your piloter was unfortunately not a very amiable person, which he demonstrated by shriveling up his nose as he glanced at you.</p>
            <p>"You sure are flaunting your social status, aren't you? You're doing a great job of announcing that you've never taken an AT before. That your sterisia you're holding?"</p>

            <p>You nodded, glancing at the device in your hand, secretly glad that you had looked up its name earlier in your room, though you hadn't thought as far as to research the methods of payment. Probably due to the consistent feeling of familiarity yet foreignness you'd been encountering throughout your time in this strange universe. Some things were obvious, and some things were not.</p>
            <p>What misfortune.</p>

            <p>You exhaled a sigh of relief as you heeded his advice and took a seat far in the back, away from your unpleasant piloter. Luckily, the AT wasn't so crowded, so you had plenty of leg room and seat options to choose from.</p>

            <p>As you glanced out the window to see the passing blur of your neighborhood, you shuddered. What would have happened if it turned out you had no way of paying? Of course, you weren't left without options, since you could have also always just sought out your personal piloter and tell him you changed your mind, but since you were already on the AT, it would have been cumbersome to have to change plans midway.</p>

            <p>Noticing a window handle, you experimented a bit, trying to figure out how to open the window a sliver. As you had expected, though the handle was solid, it felt subtly warm, like your hand just barely happened to not phase right through it. With minimal effort, you pulled it open to enjoy the breeze. It was raining out, like how your personal piloter had mentioned it might, but you didn't mind.</p>

            <p>He shrugged nonchalantly as he turned away from you to Pollux, struggling to prevent the twitch at the corner of his mouth at your reaction while he scrolled through his sterisia, occasionally showing some possible gift options to his brother. He might as well have smiled, since his eyes said it all.</p>

But... if you really thought about it, Castor wasn't so bad either. His insults were all just worries and concerns in disguise. Though you still despised that perfect smile of his.</p>
