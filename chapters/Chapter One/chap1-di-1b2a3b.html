            <p>After about five minutes, you found yourself at a very familiar-looking pole and glass box setup. According to your sterisia, this was your 'AT' stop.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>A couple more minutes later, an impressive-looking vehicle pulled to a stop in front of you. You frowned when you noticed that the 'bus' had no wheels and was therefore hovering over the ground by an inch or so. What's more, the vehicle appeared almost of translucent quality, like something that couldn't be physically touched.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it was a hologram, or some light-based concept, as many things in this universe seemed to rely on.</p>

        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>But the door opened for you nonetheless, so you boarded. That's when you realized you had no idea how to pay your fare, so you awkwardly glanced at the AT's piloter. Cringing internally, you mustered up the courage to ask a seemingly stupid question.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NECESSARY COMPONENT: STORY BLOCK BLACK -->
        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>Your piloter was unfortunately not a very amiable person, which he demonstrated by shriveling up his nose as he glanced at you.</p>
            <p>"You sure are flaunting your social status, aren't you? You're doing a great job of announcing that you've never taken an AT before. That your sterisia you're holding?"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NECESSARY COMPONENT: STORY BLOCK BLACK -->
        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>You nodded, glancing at the device in your hand, secretly glad that you had looked up its name earlier in your room, though you hadn't thought as far as to research the methods of payment. Probably due to the consistent feeling of familiarity yet foreignness you'd been encountering throughout your time in this strange universe. Some things were obvious, and some things were not.</p>
            <p>What misfortune.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NECESSARY COMPONENT: STORY BLOCK BLACK -->
        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>The piloter glanced at his dashboard and waved you inside.</p>
            <p>"Your sterisia has auto-fare-pay set up. My records say you paid on entry. You may now go take a seat, young lady."</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NECESSARY COMPONENT: STORY BLOCK BLACK -->
        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>You exhaled a sigh of relief as you heeded his advice and took a seat far in the back, away from your unpleasant piloter. Luckily, the AT wasn't so crowded, so you had plenty of leg room and seat options to choose from. As you glanced out the window to see the passing blur of your neighborhood, you shuddered. What would have happened if it turned out you had no way of paying? Of course, you weren't left without options, since you could have also always just sought out your personal piloter and tell him you changed your mind, but since you were already on the AT, it would have been cumbersome to have to change plans midway.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- NECESSARY COMPONENT: STORY BLOCK BLACK -->
        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>Noticing a window handle, you experimented a bit, trying to figure out how to open the window a sliver. As you had expected, though the handle was solid, it felt subtly warm, like your hand just barely happened to not phase right through it. With minimal effort, you pulled it open to enjoy the breeze. It was raining out, like how your personal piloter had mentioned it might, but you didn't mind.</p>

        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>You vaguely remarked that the AT pulled to a stop, letting on more passengers. You glanced briefly at the doors, before facing out your window again. After all, you wouldn't have expected the new passengers to sit right beside you on a near-empty AT, let alone address you.</p>
        </div>

            <p>"Oh wow~! If it isn't Miss Polaris."</p>
            <p>You looked to your side to meet the eyes of the two young men that sat beside you.</p>

            <p>How could a person look so... let alone two of them in a row... You quickly pushed the thought aside, remarking at once that you recognized these two -obviously- twins from one of the framed photos on Polaris' desk. You had originally thought that the photo was too generous, but now you realized that the photo hadn't done justice at all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classicTextBl" data-aos="fade" style="margin-top: 25%;">
            <p>The one that was seated right beside you exuded a somewhat arrogant demeanour, a teasing grin pulling the left corner of his lips just slightly as he looked at you with a frustratingly charming pair of eyes.</p>
            <p>"How's the noggin doing? I mean, it's not like you ever had much in there, but that was quite the hit you took. What, concussion? Heh. You're actually stupid for not seeing that coming."</p>

            <p>"And to think, when you stopped contacting me, I thought I had finally gotten rid of you."</p>

            <p>His twin tossed a stern glare at his brother, before leaning forward to give you a bubbly smile that somewhat soothed your new-found irritation.</p>
            <p>"Sorry, Polaris. You know how Castor is. Are you feeling better? We were really worried for you when we heard the news. Castor <em>included.</em>"</p>
            <p>The twin gave a pointed look at his brother as he accented his name, raising an eyebrow subtly as if daring him to refute.</p>

            <p>Castor. So that's the pompous jerk's name. Talk about visual and internal mismatch. His face belonged on all sorts of media, but his personality belonged in the trash.</p>

            <p>Castor initially seemed unfazed by his brother's remark, though he did sit up a bit in response to the unspoken scolding. He studied you intently for a moment before speaking up again.</p>
            <p>"You sure you didn't forget anything? You know memory loss, both temporary and permanent, can result from concussions. With one as bad as yours was, I honestly wouldn't be surprised. Quick, what's two plus three?"</p>
