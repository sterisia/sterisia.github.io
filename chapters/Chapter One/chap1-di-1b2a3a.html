            <p>The planet looked up at you with a pleasant, toothy grin, as she pointed to a strange, yet neatly piled stack of thin sheets, not unlike your sterisia, but paper-sized, and some odd trinkets you didn't recognize. If you had to guess, they looked almost like microscopes.</p>

            <p>You smiled and thanked her, opening up the wallet as you walked out into your front garden. There were a couple of papery bills nestled inside, about 300 stellars, based on the numbers on the bills, though you had no idea how much that amounted to in this universe. After all, for all you knew, it could have been worth the equivalent of three dollars.</p>

            <p>The handwriting on the note matched the one you had seen the most frequently in Polaris' past cards you had looked at earlier. You pocketed the wallet with your hands, feeling somewhat touched nonetheless by his gesture, as you walked out to the front gate.</p>

            <p>After some pleasant strolling, you finally encountered some impressive looking houses as opposed to tree after tree. Such was the nature of a rich neighborhood, you guessed. There were many architectural wonders in the street you were wandering through, from sweeping window tiles to sleek glass that shimmered with the smallest speck of light. If you were being honest, none came close to Polaris' mansion. Now your home in this universe, there was simply no word descriptive enough to do it justice.
