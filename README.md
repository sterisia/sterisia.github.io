A 'just-for-fun' Choose Your Own Adventure-Esque HTML hell. Reads like a female-oriented romance textual novel

***NOT OPTIMIZED FOR MOBILE VIEWING***
- Please view in full screen mode
- Story Status: Incomplete

**NOTE:**
- This is a hobby project
- Story drew ***heavy*** inspiration from Arcana Twilight (game) for some of its characters and elements (it's essentially a fan work that rips characters and inspiration and nestles them into a similar but different world + storyline)
- I am not a web developer, programmer, or developer in general, so please bear with me (by which I mean it's not perfect at all and I have no idea how to use JS to make everything appear on one page instead of using millions of linked html files to do what I want with it)
- Please actually don't play through this project because I swear I wasn't thinking straight when I decided to start/post this.
  - By which I mean I started working on it as a means to stay awake at the library so I don't pass out of boredom
